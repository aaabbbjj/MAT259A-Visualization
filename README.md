My 2D and 3D visualiaztion projects
2D Frequency Pattern Visualization
Concept

When a book being made into big screens, there will always be a discussion on whether the book or the film is more popular. Audience are born to be critics and curiosity drives people to explore and compare the book and its movie. To some extent, a book and its movie make a great pair together. The book always have a detailed story and well rounded portrayal of characters. The movie is more visually appealing and offers a multidimensional take on the original work. With the Seattle Public Library dataset we have, I am interested in looking into the possible boost that a film adaptation on the original book. 

For the purpose of better 2D visualization, I picked out 9 movies that adapted from books. They are listed below with the release date:

Twilight	2008/11/21 
New moon	2009/11/20
Eclipse	2010/6/24
Breaking Dawn	2011/11/18
Hunger Games	2012/03/23	
Catching Fire	2013/11/20
Mockingjay	2014/11/21 2015/11/20
Enders game	2013/11/01
Divergent 2014/3/21

With the help of the 2D visualization, we can clear see a pattern/trend of the adaptation movies' influence on original books. Especially if it is a book series, such as the example here for Hunger Games and Twilight Saga when the first movie released, the check out rate of the same book and the following book will boost.
